# 15-112 Term-Project MemoRe
 
## Description 
MemoRe: is an application inspired by Roam Research in which
users are given the capability to organize notes into a mind map of
interconnected thoughts. Here, users will be able to create notes using a
built-in text editor, and then link them to other notes if those other notes are mentioned within the new note. This will then organize the notes as an interconnected mind map in a workspace. Users will also be able tag notes within each mind map to highlight specific ideas and instances. Moreover, users can have multiple workspaces with different mind maps and notes. Overall, MemoRe: seeks to enable users to have a second brain in which they can traverse their past thoughts and look at how they relate to new thoughts.
